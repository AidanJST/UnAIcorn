# Titanic Survival Predictor

# This is a website that I am building to further my skills with web development and Machine Learning
The website uses a random forest ML model to give a prediction of a persons likelyhood to survive the titanic disaster based on the circumstances and demographics.
The website can be found at http://3.83.130.77 (Work in Progress)
